# StacksGPT

ChatGPT plugin to query information about STX balances for an address on the Stacks network.

This plugin uses [Hiro API](https://docs.hiro.so/).

In the the next versions, I will enable more features, such as sending and receiving STX and other tokens, interacting with smart contracts, and more.

## Steps to use
1. Publish on Replit or any web server
2. Import on ChatGPT (you need the paid version).

## Demo

- You can also to query directly using: https://stacksgpt.nescampos.repl.co/get_balance?account_id=:account_id
- Replace :account_id with the Stacks account.
